1. Obtain the Timer library folder (within this tutorial or from http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Timer)
2. Copy it into <Arduino IDE Installation Path>/library/
3. Make sure "Timer.cpp" and "Timer.h" is one level within the "Timer" folder (i.e. there is no extra "Timer" folder enclosing the actual contents)
4. Open Arduino IDE
5. Confirm that "File -> Examples -> Timer" exists
6. You're ready to go :)

Requirements:
1. A completed (and working) circuit mounted on a chassis
2. An Arduino UNO
3. ATMega328P-PU micro-controller (ATMega328-PU should also work), properly boot-loaded
4. A flat screw driver used to pop out the chip from the base (or from the Arduino)

Steps:
1. Install the chip onto the Arduino
2. Connect the Arduino to your computer
3. Upload the program to the chip through the Arduino
4. Disconnect the Arduino from your computer and take out the chip
5. Install the chip onto your Sumo Bot
6. Turn it on and observe
7. If there is any problem (code bugs), modify the code
8. Take out the chip from the Sumo Bot and re-install it back to the Arduino
9. Repeat steps 2 to 6 until the Sumo Bot moves correctly (depending your strategy)

To Get Sensor Readings for the Code:
1. Connect the sensor directly to the Arduino (use 5V and GND on the Arduino as the power source for the sensor)
2. Write a simple program that uses the Serial Terminal to get the readings from the Analog port (see Embedded Lecture Slides for details)
3. Record the numbers (e.g. readings from proximity sensor the corresponds to different distance) and use them as reference for the code
